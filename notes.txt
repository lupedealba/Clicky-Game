so first i need to figure out how to add the images and make them:
"The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each ima-
ge should listen for click events."

Then create a score keeper:
"The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented
 when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click
  the same image more than once."
